# Intelligent Customer Support Assistant with MCP Frameworks

## Scenario
Build a customer support system where an LLM interacts with company data (tickets, FAQs, user profiles) and performs automated actions like closing tickets, sending responses, or updating customer information.

---

## Components

### Resources (Data Endpoints)
- Customer profiles (name, subscription plan, support history)
- Ticket metadata (open/closed status, priority, assigned agent)
- FAQ database (question-answer pairs)

### Tools (Actions)
- Summarize an open ticket for the support agent
- Suggest a response to a ticket
- Update ticket status or assign it to a team member
- Retrieve related FAQ answers for a customer query

### Prompts / LLM Instructions
- "Analyze this ticket and suggest a priority level."
- "Given this customerâ€™s history, recommend a solution using available tools."
- "Generate a polite response summarizing the resolution steps."

## Benchmarking Points

1. **Latency of Operations**
   - Measure how fast each framework allows the LLM to fetch ticket data, summarize, and generate responses.

2. **Throughput Under Load**
   - Simulate multiple simultaneous customer requests to see which framework handles concurrent LLM interactions better.

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - **FastMCP:** Define resources, tools, and prompts explicitly; more flexibility but more setup.  
   - **FastAPI-MCP:** Leverage existing FastAPI endpoints for tickets and FAQs; quicker integration.

4. **Security & Permissions**
   - Test access control to ensure only authorized LLM queries can update tickets.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Check how each framework manages failures when an LLM request cannot complete or external APIs fail.
